	abstract = {Context: Code review is a widely used technique of systematic examination of code changes which aims at increasing software quality. Code reviews provide several benefits for the project, including finding bugs, knowledge transfer, and assurance of adherence to project guidelines and coding style. However, code reviews have a major cost: they can delay the merge of the code change, and thus, impact the overall development process. This cost can be even higher if developers do not understand something, i.e., when developers face confusion during the code review. Objective: This paper studies the phenomenon of confusion in code reviews. Understanding confusion is an important starting point to help reducing the cost of code reviews and enhance the effectiveness of this practice, and hence, improve the development process. Method: We conducted two complementary studies. The first one aimed at identifying the reasons for confusion in code reviews, its impacts, and the coping strategies developers use to deal with it. Then, we surveyed developers to identify the most frequently experienced reasons for confusion, and conducted a systematic mapping study of solutions proposed for those reasons in the scientific literature. Results: From the first study, we build a framework with 30 reasons for confusion, 14 impacts, and 13 coping strategies. The results of the systematic mapping study shows 38 articles addressing the most frequent reasons for confusion. From those articles, we found 19 different solutions for confusion proposed in the literature, and nine impacts were established related to the most frequent reasons for confusion. Conclusions: Based on the solutions identified in the mapping study, or the lack of them, we propose an actionable guideline for developers on how to cope with confusion during code reviews; we also make several suggestions how tool builders can support code reviews. Additionally, we propose a research agenda for researchers studying code reviews.},

	abstract={Developers usually need to use different kinds of tools in the software development process, e.g., version control systems, code review tools, and bug or issue tracking systems. Some of those tools provide an enhanced approach for developers to communicate, i.e., discussions are recorded in the communication feature of those tools. There is important information, i.e., discussions and decisions, registered by those tools which are not propagated to the project documentation: the transient information. Thus, this work investigates how to improve the software documentation by making such transient important information into persistent documentation as source code comments. The results are relevant because they will aid the comprehension of the source code not only during the development process, but also in code reviews.},

	abstract={Code review is a software quality assurance practice widely employed in both open source and commercial software projects to detect defects, transfer knowledge and encourage adherence to coding standards. Notwithstanding, code reviews can also delay the incorporation of a code change into a code base, thus slowing down the overall development process. Part of this delay is often a consequence of reviewers not understanding, becoming confused by, or being uncertain about the intention, behavior, or effect of a code change.We investigate the reasons and impacts of confusion in code reviews, as well as the strategies developers adopt to cope with confusion. We employ a concurrent triangulation strategy to combine the analyses of survey responses and of the code review comments, and build a comprehensive confusion framework structured along the dimensions of the review process, the artifact being reviewed, the developers themselves and the relation between the developer and the artifact. The most frequent reasons for confusion are the missing rationale, discussion of non-functional requirements of the solution, and lack of familiarity with existing code. Developers report that confusion delays the merge decision, decreases review quality, and results in additional discussions. To cope with confusion developers request information, improve familiarity with existing code, and discuss off-line. Based on the results, we provide a series of implications for tool builders, as well as insights and suggestions for researchers. The results of our work offer empirical justification for the need to improve code review tools to support developers facing confusion.},

	abstract={During code review, developers request clarifications, suggest improvements, or ask for explanations about the rationale behind the implementation choices. We envision the emergence of tools to support developers during code review based on the automatic analysis of the argumentation structure and communicative intentions conveyed by developers' comments. As a preliminary step towards this goal, we conducted an exploratory case study by manually classifying 499 questions extracted from 399 Android code reviews to understand the real communicative intentions they convey. We observed that the majority of questions actually serve information seeking goals. Still, they represent less than half of the annotated sample, with other questions being used to serve a wider variety of developers' communication goals, including suggestions, request for action, and criticism. Based on our findings we formulate hypotheses on communicative intentions in code reviews that should be confirmed or rejected by follow-up studies.},

	abstract={Code reviews are an important mechanism for assuring quality of source code changes. Reviewers can either add general comments pertaining to the entire change or pinpoint concerns or shortcomings about a specific part of the change using inline comments. Recent studies show that reviewers often do not understand the change being reviewed and its context.Our ultimate goal is to identify the factors that confuse code reviewers and understand how confusion impacts the efficiency and effectiveness of code review(er)s. As the first step towards this goal we focus on the identification of confusion in developers' comments. Based on an existing theoretical framework categorizing expressions of confusion, we manually classify 800 comments from code reviews of the Android project. We observe that confusion can be reasonably well-identified by humans: raters achieve moderate agreement (Fleiss' kappa 0.59 for the general comments and 0.49 for the inline ones). Then, for each kind of comment we build a series of automatic classifiers that, depending on the goals of the further analysis, can be trained to achieve high precision (0.875 for the general comments and 0.615 for the inline ones), high recall (0.944 for the general comments and 0.988 for the inline ones), or substantial precision and recall (0.696 and 0.542 for the general comments and 0.434 and 0.583 for the inline ones, respectively). These results motivate further research on the impact of confusion on the code review process. Moreover, other researchers can employ the proposed classifiers to analyze confusion in other contexts where software development-related discussions occur, such as mailing lists.},

	year={2016},
	volume={1},
	number={},
	pages={634-638},
	abstract={Recently, Apple released Swift, a modern programming language built to be the successor of Objective-C. In less than a year and a half after its first release, Swift became one of the most popular programming languages in the world, considering different popularity measures. A significant part of this success is due to Apple's strict control over its ecosystem, and the clear message that it will replace Objective-C in a near future. According to Apple, "Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language[...]. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive." However, little is known about how Swift developers perceive these benefits. In this paper, we conducted two studies aimed at uncovering the questions and strains that arise from this early adoption. First, we perform a thorough analysis on 59,156 questions asked about Swift on StackOverflow. Second, we interviewed 12 Swift developers to cross-validate the initial results. Our study reveals that developers do seem to find the language easy to understand and adopt, although 17.5% of the questions are about basic elements of the language. Still, there are many questions about problems in the toolset (compiler, Xcode, libraries). Some of our interviewees reinforced these problems.},

	abstract = {We study exception handling bugs from two real systems. We survey developers to understand their thoughts about exception handling bugs. Analysis of bug repositories shows small percentages of exception handling bugs. Exception handling bugs seems to be as hard to fix as other kind of bugs.We create an exception handling bug classification. Most mainstream programming languages provide constructs to throw and to handle exceptions. However, several studies argue that exception handling code is usually of poor quality and that it is commonly neglected by developers. Moreover, it is said to be the least understood, documented, and tested part of the implementation of a system. Nevertheless, there are very few studies that analyze the actual exception handling bugs that occur in real software systems or that attempt to understand developers' perceptions of these bugs. In this work we present an exploratory study on exception handling bugs that employs two complementary approaches: a survey of 154 developers and an analysis of 220 exception handling bugs from the repositories of Eclipse and Tomcat. Only 27% of the respondents claimed that policies and standards for the implementation of error handling are part of the culture of their organizations. Moreover, in 70% of the organizations there are no specific tests for the exception handling code. Also, 61% of the respondents stated that no to little importance is given to the documentation of exception handling in the design phase of the projects with which they are involved. In addition, about 40% of the respondents consider the quality of exception handling code to be either good or very good and only 14% of the respondents consider it to be bad or very bad. Furthermore, the repository analysis has shown (with statistical significance) that exception handling bugs are ignored by developers less often than other bugs. We have also observed that while overly general catch blocks are a well-known bad smell related to exceptions, bugs stemming from these catch blocks are rare, even though many overly general catch blocks occur in the code. Furthermore, while developers often mention empty catch blocks as causes of bugs they have fixed in the past, we found very few bug reports caused by them. On top of that, empty catch blocks are frequently used as part of bug fixes, including fixes for exception handling bugs. Based on our findings, we propose a classification of exception handling bugs and their causes. The proposed classification can be used to assist in the design and implementation of test suites, to guide code inspections, or as a basis for static analysis tools.},

	abstract={Over the last years, energy consumption has become a first-class citizen in software development practice. While energy-efficient solutions on lower-level layers of the software stack are well-established, there is convincing evidence that even better results can be achieved by encouraging practitioners to participate in the process. For instance, previous work has shown that using a newer version of a concurrent data structure can yield a 2.19x energy savings when compared to the old associative implementation [75]. Nonetheless, little is known about how much software engineers are employing energy-efficient solutions in their applications and what solutions they employ for improving energy-efficiency. In this paper we present a qualitative study of "energy-aware commits". Using Github as our primary data source, we perform a thorough analysis on an initial sample of 2,189 commits and carefully curate a set of 371 energy-aware commits spread over 317 real-world non-trivial applications. Our study reveals that software developers heavily rely on low-level energy management approaches, such as frequency scaling and multiple levels of idleness. Also, our findings suggest that ill-chosen energy saving techniques can impact the correctness of an application. Yet, we found what we call "energy-aware interfaces", which are means for clients (e.g., Developers or end-users) to save energy in their applications just by using a function, abstracting away the low-level implementation details.},

Also, many of the respondents have had to fix exception handling bugs, in particular those caused by empty catch blocks or exceptions caught unintentionally. The respondents believe that exception handling bugs are more easily fixed than other kinds of bugs. Also, we found out a significant difference in the opinion of the respondents pertaining to the quality of the exception handling code: more experienced developers tend to believe that it is worse.

  abstract={Exception handling is a feature provided by most mainstream programming languages, and typically involves constructs to throw and handle error signals. On the one hand, early work has argued extensively about the benefits of exception handling, such as promoting modularity by defining how exception handlers can be implemented and maintained independently of the normal behavior of the system and easing but localization. On the other hand, some studies argue that exception handling can make the programming languages unnecessarily complex and promote the introduction of subtle bugs in programs. In 2015 we published a paper describing a study investigating the prevalence and nature of exception handling bugs in two large, widely adopted Java systems. This study also confronted its findings about real exception handling bugs with the perceptions of developers about those bugs, also accounting for bugs not related to exception handling. The goal of this reflection paper is to investigate the state of the art in exception handling research, with a particular emphasis on exception handling bugs, and how our paper has influenced other studies in the area. We found that our paper was cited by 33 articles, and all themes for future work we raised in our paper have been tackled by other studies in the short span of five years.},

	title={On the Adoption of Kotlin on Android Development: A Triangulation Study},
	year={2020},
	volume={},
	number={},
	pages={206-216},
	abstract={In 2017, Google announced Kotlin as one of the officially supported languages for Android development. Among the reasons for choosing Kotlin, Google mentioned it is “concise, expressive, and designed to be type and null-safe”. Another important reason is that Kotlin is a language fully interoperable with Java and runs on the JVM. Despite Kotlin's rapid rise in the industry, very little has been done in academia to understand how developers are dealing with the adoption of Kotlin. The goal of this study is to understand how developers are dealing with the recent adoption of Kotlin as an official language for Android development, their perception about the advantages and disadvantages related to its usage, and the most common problems faced by them. This research was conducted using the concurrent triangulation strategy, which is a mixed-method approach. We performed a thorough analysis of 9,405 questions related to Kotlin development for the Android platform on Stack Overflow. Concurrently, we also conducted a basic qualitative research interviewing seven Android developers that use Kotlin to confirm and cross-validate our findings. Our study reveals that developers do seem to find the language easy to understand and to adopt it. This perception begins to change when the functional paradigm becomes more evident. Accordingly to the developers, the readability and legibility are compromised if developers overuse the functional flexibility that the language provides. The developers also consider that Kotlin increases the quality of the produced code mainly due to its null-safety guarantees, but it can also become a challenge when interoperating with Java, despite the interoperability being considered as an advantage. While adopting Kotlin requires some care from developers, its benefits seem to bring many advantages to the platform according to the developers, especially in the aspect of adopting a more modern language while maintaining the consolidated Java-based development environment.},
